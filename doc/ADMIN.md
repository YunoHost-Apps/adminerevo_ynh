## Configuration

You need to know the root password from here `/etc/yunohost/mysql` or the app username and password from `setting.yml` under `/etc/yunohost/apps/appname` to login.
For themes download the `adminer.css` from the main website and replace the file in the app folder.
If you have problems with drivers see here: https://www.adminer.org/en/drivers.
